          To a certain extent, there’s a limit to what company executives can
          control. They can put in place an expert sales and marketing team.

          But at the end of the day, the market is going to have the final say
          on how that transitions to revenue and profits. Every industry goes
          through ups and downs, on both a market segment and macroeconomic
          level.

          CEOs, CFOs and other senior executives can’t influence the wider
          economy, but what they can control is expenses. That’s why, when it
          comes to projecting the future financial performance of a company,
          expense forecasting is a powerful tool that’s worth taking the time to
          get right.

        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          Having a clear and consistent projection on the company’s costs will
          allow a far better understanding of how the business can be expected
          to perform through all stages of the market cycle.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">

          What Is an Expense Forecast?
        </h4>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          An expense forecast is simply a projection of your future company
          costs. While the concept is fairly straightforward, the practicalities
          of actually putting together an accurate forecast are more complex
          than it can first appear.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          That being said, building an accurate and usable forecast is critical
          for any type of business, but especially for SaaS startups. They’re so
          important, in fact, that we have a term for it: burn rate.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          When you have a clear view of your burn rate, you have a clear view of
          the length of your cash runway. The goal is to line up expenses with
          natural revenue growth and funding roads so that you can reach your
          end goal: profitability. Expense forecasts can be used to find obvious
          (and not so obvious) areas where spend can be reduced and the length
          of your cash runway optimized to promote sustainable growth.

          Why Is Expense Forecasting Important?
        </h4>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          It goes without saying the economy has been rough these past few
          years. Things have been unpredictable, and we’ve seen huge market
          shifts. The unfortunate truth is that 90% of startups fail. So,
          understanding your burn rate is crucial.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          Even successful startups have had to resort to mass layoffs. Though
          things seem to be slightly improving, there’s still a lot of
          hesitation. That being said, startups can still find success if they
          plan. That requires a clear view of your cash burn rate and how that
          relates to revenue growth rate and headcount.

          How to Forecast Expenses
        </h4>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          At its most basic, to make an expense forecast you can simply take
          last year’s costs, add a percentage increase (say, 4%) to that number,
          and you’re done. There’s a bit more to it than that, though historical
          projections are a part of it.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          First, recognize that it’s impossible to separate expenses from
          revenue growth and your 
          <a href="#" className="text-[#5F57FF] underline">
            budgeting process
          </a>
          . In financial planning, it’s common to look at expenses as a
          percentage of revenue. That’s why, to forecast expenses, the first
          thing you’ll need to do is forecast revenue.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          Of course, there are a couple different high-level approaches to
          revenue forecasting: the top-down approach, and the bottom-up
          approach.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          The top-down approach is all about the leaders of the company creating
          (realistic) revenue targets, then communicating exactly how to achieve
          these goals to individual departments.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          A bottom-up approach goes the other direction — department heads would
          create their own plans, justifying each expense in terms of how
          they’ll match the revenue goals set by leadership.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          The first thing to do is determine how much you’re going to spend each
          month. Consider all costs. How much are you setting aside for
          marketing? What about hosting costs?
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          Since certain expenses may depend on your headcount, you also need to
          work your headcount models into your expense forecasting — for
          example, if you know each new employee will require a $1,500 laptop,
          you can put that on the list.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          But you also need to break things down by department — depending on
          the overall business strategy, some departments might be planning
          major expansion in the upcoming months or years, while others business
          units could be cutting back or closing down completely.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          In order for an expense forecast to be as accurate as possible,
          finance teams need to look at each of these individual components and
          project them out individually.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          The last step is to review your forecasts. This can help you make
          future forecasts tighter, leading to less waste on variances. Do this
          at least once a month, using the insights to aid in creating new
          budgets. So, that’s a general outline of how to forecast expenses.
          Let’s get a bit more granular by looking at how to forecast operating
          and payroll expenses.

          How to Forecast Expenses
        </h4>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          Your operating expenses include day-to-day line items, which you’ll
          find on the income statement. For SaaS companies, they include
          salaries, marketing costs, and hosting costs. Operating expenses are
          divided into two types: fixed and variable.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          Fixed expenses like rent and depreciation and amortization are easy
          enough to forecast, as they generally won’t change from month to
          month.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          However, some expenses do change from month to month — these are your
          variable expenses, which are tied directly to how many sales you make.
          Variable expenses include your marketing costs, travel costs, and
          commissions. Notably for SaaS companies, they include your hosting
          costs, known as cost of revenue or SaaS cost of goods sold.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          Once again, since variable expenses depend on sales, the first thing
          you’ll want to do is forecast revenue. Your{" "}

          can (and should) be a lot more in-depth than simply estimating a
          “reasonable” growth rate. If you have a good amount of historical
          data, you might use a sales capacity model, which maps out the number
          of sales reps you’ll need to hit specific goals.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          If you don’t have a lot of historical data, you could use the ARR
          snowball method, which builds off of short-term revenue trends. Of
          course, this method is more dependent on assumptions than the sales
          capacity model, so make sure you get those down pat.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[400] text-[18px] text-[#36394A]">
          So, you have your estimate of future revenue — how do you get your
          projection of variable expenses? The answer is calculating historical
          operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.
